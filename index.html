      + Mbappé has been described by Arsène Wenger as a "huge football talent"
      who "has similarities to Thierry Henry".[188] His talent and precocious
      performances for France at the 2018 World Cup also led him to be compared
      to Pelé in the media.[189] A versatile forward, Mbappé often plays as a
      winger, and is capable of playing on either flank, due to his ability with
      both feet.[190][191] He is capable of cutting into the centre onto his
      stronger right foot from the left wing, and is also capable of creating
      chances and providing assists for teammates from the right due to his
      vision.[192][193][194][195] He is also able to play in the centre as a
      main striker, due to his composure, clinical finishing, and eye for goal
